# World-Population-Analysis

This project analyzes historical world population data to understand past trends and predict future population dynamics. By leveraging machine learning, the project uncovers key factors influencing population growth, such as fertility rates, birth/death rates, and net migration, providing insights valuable for planning and policymaking. The analysis spans data from 1970 to 2022, covering diverse metrics like population density, growth rate, and world population percentages for countries and continents.

# Objective

The primary objective is to build predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast future population trends. Additionally, it aims to visualize patterns and highlight growth disparities across regions and countries.
